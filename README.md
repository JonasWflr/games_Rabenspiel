# Rabenspiel / Obstgarten / Orchard-Game

Analysis of the game *Obstgarten* (in english it might be called *Orchard-Game*) by Ravensburger.

Everybody is playing against the raven. I had the impression, that the raven won very often, therefore I've done a little analysis. It turns out, it wins approximatly one in three games, which is reasonable.

Later, I found the same analysis on the great blog https://datagenetics.com/blog/january62021/index.html

That blog inspired me to do this analysis. I read an entry about snakes and ladders and coded that as well as an exercise and because it is fun (see other repository). Then I took the orchard game because I was curiuous.
